Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve performance from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Key Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. Examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning  
Unsupervised learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.

3. Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a machine learning training method based on rewarding desired behaviors and/or punishing undesired ones. In general, a reinforcement learning agent is able to perceive and interpret its environment, take actions and learn through trial and error.

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles

The process typically involves data collection, data preparation, choosing a model, training the model, evaluation, parameter tuning, and prediction.
